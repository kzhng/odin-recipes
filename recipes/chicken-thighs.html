    <h2 class="sub-head">Description</h2>
    <p>These easy baked chicken thighs require minimum preparation; I love this quick recipe because I'm a college student! Feel free to season the chicken with your favorite spices. I like to use cayenne powder and black pepper.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-head">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons onion flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="sub-head">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a baking dish; season both sides with garlic powder and onion flakes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
